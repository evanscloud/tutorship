# Tutorship

A Git(Hub) powered platform for publishing interactive programming courses.

## Why

#### 1. Easy writing with Markdown

Tutorship uses [Markdown][markdown] for writing course content which is a lightweight markup language.

[markdown]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown

#### 2. Easy to configure

You should easily configure your course to the way you like, including lessons, step conditions, and grades.

#### 3. Internationalization

Tutorship has built-in internationalization (i18n) support.

#### 4. Open source course development

A Tutorship course is a simple GitHub repository, so you get all the GitHub awesomeness (i.e. Fork, Pull Requests, issues ...etc) for free.

As a course author, You usually don't need to start from scratch, simply fork an existing course then extend it.

Your students can even report bugs directly to GitHub issues.

Above all, you can get help from the awesome open source contributors around the world!

#### 5. Course versioning

Again, just like any GitHub repository, you can version your course, and tell the followers what changed.

Students can also decide to take the course again if there is a major change.

Fixed a bug? no need to worry, all those who are currently enrolled in that course will receive your fix auto-magically :)

#### 6. Work offline

Online interactive platforms require very good network which isn't available always. In Tutorship, most of the learning part is done offline.

#### 7. Dependencies management

Tutorship utilizes [Docker][docker] for managing course dependencies and knows how to configure and install a course, you don't need to install anything but Docker, and Tutorship CLI and Tutorship will take the care of the rest.

[docker]: https://docker.com

#### 8. Not just code!

Do you miss your lovely text editor, code linting, snippets, your editor's key-mapping ...etc when using online code platform? Not anymore!

Tutorship seamlessly integrate with the tools you already uses and love, prefer Atom, Visual Studio Code? no problem, you name it.
